Note that you can reorder the remaining characters in any way.\n\nA palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, the strings \"z\", \"aaa\", \"aba\", \"abccba\" are palindromes, while the strings \"codeforces\", \"reality\", \"ab\" are not.\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) — the number of the test cases. This is followed by their description.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($0 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^5$) — the length of the string $s$ and the number of characters to be deleted.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if it is possible to remove exactly $k$ characters from the string $s$ in such a way that the remaining characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (uppercase or lowercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive answers.Sample Input 1:\n14\n\n1 0\n\na\n\n2 0\n\nab\n\n2 1\n\nba\n\n3 1\n\nabb\n\n3 2\n\nabc\n\n6 2\n\nbacacd\n\n6 2\n\nfagbza\n\n6 2\n\nzwaafa\n\n7 2\n\ntaagaak\n\n14 3\n\nttrraakkttoorr\n\n5 3\n\ndebdb\n\n5 4\n\necadc\n\n5 3\n\ndebca\n\n5 3\n\nabaac\n\n\n\nSample Output 1:\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, nothing can be removed, and the string \"a\" is a palindrome.\n\nIn the second test case, nothing can be removed, but the strings \"ab\" and \"ba\" are not palindromes.\n\nIn the third test case, any character can be removed, and the resulting string will be a palindrome.\n\nIn the fourth test case, one occurrence of the character \"a\" can be removed, resulting in the string \"bb\", which is a palindrome.\n\nIn the sixth test case, one occurrence of the characters \"b\" and \"d\" can be removed, resulting in the string \"acac\", which can be rearranged to the string \"acca\".\n\nIn the ninth test case, one occurrence of the characters \"t\" and \"k\" can be removed, resulting in the string \"aagaa\", which is a palindrome.",

    "question_title": "D. Yarik and Musical Notes",
    "question_content": "Yarik is a big fan of many kinds of music. But Yarik loves not only listening to music but also writing it. He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\n\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\ge 1$ — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$. In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ $(i < j)$ such that $b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}$. Help him find the number of such pairs.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) — the length of the arrays.\n\nThe next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$) — array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the number of pairs that satisfy the given condition.Sample Input 1:\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3 1 3 2\n\n2\n\n1000 1000\n\n3\n\n1 1 1\n\n19\n\n2 4 1 6 2 8 5 4 2 10 5 10 8 7 4 3 2 6 10\n\n\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n0\n2\n1\n3\n19\n",

The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 6, and we can show that 6 is the maximum we can obtain.\n\nFor the 2nd query x_i = 1 and y_i = 3, we can select index j = 2 since nums1[j] >= 1 and nums2[j] >= 3. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 10, and we can show that 10 is the maximum we can obtain. \n\nFor the 3rd query x_i = 2 and y_i = 5, we can select index j = 3 since nums1[j] >= 2 and nums2[j] >= 5. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 7, and we can show that 7 is the maximum we can obtain.\n\nTherefore, we return [6,10,7].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums1 = [3,2,5], nums2 = [2,3,4], queries = [[4,4],[3,2],[1,1]]\nOutput: [9,9,9]\nExplanation: For this example, we can use index j = 2 for all the queries since it satisfies the constraints for each query.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums1 = [2,1], nums2 = [2,3], queries = [[3,3]]\nOutput: [-1]\nExplanation: There is one query in this example with x_i = 3 and y_i = 3.

    "question_content": "You are given an integer n and a 0-indexed integer array sick which is sorted in increasing order.\nThere are n children standing in a queue with positions 0 to n - 1 assigned to them. The array sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\nNote that an infection sequence does not contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, sick = [0,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Children at positions 1, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 4 possible infection sequences:\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected since their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 2 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 3 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 2 and 4 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,2,3].\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected because their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 3 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 2 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 1 and 3 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,3,2].\n- The infection sequence is [3,1,2]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].\n- The infection sequence is [3,2,1]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, sick = [1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Children at positions 0, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 3 possible infection sequences:\n- The infection sequence is [0,2,3]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3].\n- The infection sequence is [2,0,3]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3].\n- The infection sequence is [2,3,0].

For example, 121, 2552 and 65756 are palindromic numbers whereas 24, 46, 235 are not palindromic numbers.\nAn array is considered equalindromic if all the elements in the array are equal to an integer y, where y is a palindromic number less than 10^9.\nReturn an integer denoting the minimum possible total cost to make nums equalindromic by performing any number of special moves.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 3 which is a palindromic number.

So the sum of their prices is 2.\nThe fourth bit of binary representation of numbers 8 and 9 is a set bit but their second bit is not. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nNumbers 1, 4, and 5 don't have set bits in their even^th bits in their binary representation. So the sum of their prices is 0.\nThe second and the fourth bit of the binary representation of the number 10 are a set bit.

The `count_set_bits` function counts the number of set bits in a given number, and the `count_prices` function calculates the sum of prices of all numbers from 1 to `num`. The binary search is performed on the range `[1, 10^15]`, and the midpoint is checked using the `count_prices` function. If the sum of prices is less than or equal to `k`, the search continues in the right half of the range; otherwise, it continues in the left half. The final result is the maximum number `num` that satisfies the condition."

For each starting position, it calculates the number of ones to the left and right of the starting position, and then calculates the number of ones that can be picked up using maxChanges. It then calculates the number of moves required to pick up the ones from the middle, left, and right, and updates the result if the total number of moves is less than the current result. Finally, it returns the result."

In particular, intervals sharing a left or right boundary are considered overlapping.\nAn array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if in the first position where a and b differ, array a has an element that is less than the corresponding element in b.\nIf the first min(a.length, b.length) elements do not differ, then the shorter array is the lexicographically smaller one.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: intervals = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5],[6,9,3],[6,7,1],[8,9,1]]\nOutput: [2,3]\nExplanation:\nYou can choose the intervals with indices 2, and 3 with respective weights of 5, and 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: intervals = [[5,8,1],[6,7,7],[4,7,3],[9,10,6],[7,8,2],[11,14,3],[3,5,5]]\nOutput: [1,3,5,6]\nExplanation:\nYou can choose the intervals with indices 1, 3, 5, and 6 with respective weights of 7, 6, 3, and 5.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= intevals.length <= 5 * 10^4\nintervals[i].length == 3\nintervals[i] = [l_i, r_i, weight_i]\n1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9\n1 <= weight_i <= 10^9",

In each round, players simultaneously summon their creature and are awarded points as follows:\n\nIf one player summons a Fire Dragon and the other summons an Earth Golem, the player who summoned the Fire Dragon is awarded a point.\nIf one player summons a Water Serpent and the other summons a Fire Dragon, the player who summoned the Water Serpent is awarded a point.\nIf one player summons an Earth Golem and the other summons a Water Serpent, the player who summoned the Earth Golem is awarded a point.\nIf both players summon the same creature, no player is awarded a point.\n\nYou are given a string s consisting of n characters 'F', 'W', and 'E', representing the sequence of creatures Alice will summon in each round:\n\nIf s[i] == 'F', Alice summons a Fire Dragon.\nIf s[i] == 'W', Alice summons a Water Serpent.\nIf s[i] == 'E', Alice summons an Earth Golem.\n\nBob’s sequence of moves is unknown, but it is guaranteed that Bob will never summon the same creature in two consecutive rounds. Bob beats Alice if the total number of points awarded to Bob after n rounds is strictly greater than the points awarded to Alice.\nReturn the number of distinct sequences Bob can use to beat Alice.\nSince the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"FFF\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nBob can beat Alice by making one of the following sequences of moves: \"WFW\", \"FWF\", or \"WEW\". Note that other winning sequences like \"WWE\" or \"EWW\" are invalid since Bob cannot make the same move twice in a row.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"FWEFW\"\nOutput: 18\nExplanation:\nBob can beat Alice by making one of the following sequences of moves: \"FWFWF\", \"FWFWE\", \"FWEFE\", \"FWEWE\", \"FEFWF\", \"FEFWE\", \"FEFEW\", \"FEWFE\", \"WFEFE\", \"WFEWE\", \"WEFWF\", \"WEFWE\", \"WEFEF\", \"WEFEW\", \"WEWFW\", \"WEWFE\", \"EWFWE\", or \"EWEWE\".\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns[i] is one of 'F', 'W', or 'E'.",

Since node 0 is the root, parent[0] == -1.\nYou are also given a string s of length n, where s[i] is the character assigned to node i.\nConsider an empty string dfsStr, and define a recursive function dfs(int x) that takes a node x as a parameter and performs the following steps in order:\n\nIterate over each child y of x in increasing order of their numbers, and call dfs(y).\nAdd the character s[x] to the end of the string dfsStr.\n\nNote that dfsStr is shared across all recursive calls of dfs.\nYou need to find a boolean array answer of size n, where for each index i from 0 to n - 1, you do the following:\n\nEmpty the string dfsStr and call dfs(i).\nIf the resulting string dfsStr is a palindrome, then set answer[i] to true.

In each operation, you increment any element of the subarray by 1.\nNote that each subarray is considered independently, meaning changes made to one subarray do not persist to another.\nReturn the number of subarrays that you can make non-decreasing ​​​​​after performing at most k operations.\nAn array is said to be non-decreasing if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element, if it exists.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [6,3,1,2,4,4], k = 7\nOutput: 17\nExplanation:\nOut of all 21 possible subarrays of nums, only the subarrays [6, 3, 1], [6, 3, 1, 2], [6, 3, 1, 2, 4] and [6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4] cannot be made non-decreasing after applying up to k = 7 operations. Thus, the number of non-decreasing subarrays is 21 - 4 = 17.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [6,3,1,3,6], k = 4\nOutput: 12\nExplanation:\nThe subarray [3, 1, 3, 6] along with all subarrays of nums with three or fewer elements, except [6, 3, 1], can be made non-decreasing after k operations. There are 5 subarrays of a single element, 4 subarrays of two elements, and 2 subarrays of three elements except [6, 3, 1], so there are 1 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 12 subarrays that can be made non-decreasing.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n1 <= k <= 10^9",

There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.\nALL: mentions all users.\nHERE: mentions all online users.\n\n\n\n\nOffline Event: [\"OFFLINE\", \"timestamp_i\", \"id_i\"]\n\nThis event indicates that the user id_i had become offline at timestamp_i for 60 time units.

We describe the moves below.\n\n- \n1-st move: S_i is L, so he moves to point (-1,0).  His health reduces to 0.\n\n- \n2-nd move: S_i is D, so he moves to point (-1,-1).  His health reduces to -1.  Now that the health is -1, he collapses and stops moving.\n\n\nThus, he will be stunned, so No should be printed.\nNote that although there is an item at his initial point (0,0), he does not consume it before the 1-st move, because items are only consumed after a move.",

He repeated the following operation until every pair of vertices in the graph was connected:\n\n- choose two vertices in the graph.  Here, the vertices must be disconnected, and their degrees must be both 1.  Add an edge that connects the chosen two vertices.\n\nHe then arbitrarily assigned an integer from 1 through N to each of the vertices in the graph after the procedure.  The resulting graph is a tree; we call it T.  T has (N-1) edges, the i-th of which connects u_i and v_i.\nTakahashi has now forgotten the number and levels of the stars that he initially had.

In other words, for all triplets of distinct programmers (person X, person Y, person Z), it holds that:\n\n- if person X is stronger than person Y and person Y is stronger than person Z, then person X is stronger than person Z.\n\nA person X is said to be the strongest programmer if person X is stronger than person Y for all people Y other than person X.  (Under the constraints above, we can prove that there is always exactly one such person.)  \nYou have M pieces of information on their superiority.  The i-th of them is that \"person A_i is stronger than person B_i.\"\nCan you determine the strongest programmer among the N based on the information?\nIf you can, print the person's number.

Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left, and (i, j) is land if the j-th character of S_i is ., and (i, j) is sea if the character is #.\nThe constraints guarantee that all cells on the perimeter of the grid (that is, the cells (i, j) that satisfy at least one of i = 1, i = H, j = 1, j = W) are sea.\nTakahashi's spaceship has crash-landed on a cell in the grid. Afterward, he moved N times on the grid following the instructions represented by a string T of length N consisting of L, R, U, and D. For i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N, the i-th character of T describes the i-th move as follows:\n\n- L indicates a move of one cell to the left. That is, if he is at (i, j) before the move, he will be at (i, j-1) after the move.\n- R indicates a move of one cell to the right. That is, if he is at (i, j) before the move, he will be at (i, j+1) after the move.\n- U indicates a move of one cell up. That is, if he is at (i, j) before the move, he will be at (i-1, j) after the move.\n- D indicates a move of one cell down. That is, if he is at (i, j) before the move, he will be at (i+1, j) after the move.\n\nIt is known that all cells along his path (including the cell where he crash-landed and the cell he is currently on) are not sea.

Currently, all players have zero points.\nTakahashi's foreseeing ability lets him know how the players' scores will change. Specifically, for i=1,2,\\dots,T, the score of player A_i will increase by B_i points at i seconds from now. There will be no other change in the scores.\nTakahashi, who prefers diversity in scores, wants to know how many different score values will appear among the players' scores at each moment. For each i=1,2,\\dots,T, find the number of different score values among the players' scores at i+0.5 seconds from now.\nFor example, if the players have 10, 20, 30, and 20 points at some moment, there are three different score values among the players' scores at that moment.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN T\nA_1 B_1\nA_2 B_2\n\\vdots\nA_T B_T\n\nOutput\n\nPrint T lines.\nThe i-th line (1\\leq i \\leq T) should contain an integer representing the number of different score values among the players' scores at i+0.5 seconds from now.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1\\leq N, T\\leq 2\\times 10^5\n- 1\\leq A_i \\leq N\n- 1\\leq B_i \\leq 10^9\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 4\n1 10\n3 20\n2 10\n2 10\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n3\n2\n2\n\nLet S be the sequence of scores of players 1, 2, 3 in this order.\nCurrently, S=\\lbrace 0,0,0\\rbrace.\n\n- After one second, the score of player 1 increases by 10 points, making S=\\lbrace 10,0,0\\rbrace.

    "question_content": "There is a 3 \\times 3 grid. Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left (1 \\leq i, j \\leq 3). Cell (i, j) contains an integer A_{i,j}. It is guaranteed that \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 A_{i,j} is odd. Additionally, all cells are initially painted white.\nTakahashi and Aoki will play a game using this grid. Takahashi goes first, and they take turns performing the following operation:\n\n- Choose a cell (i, j) (1\\leq i, j \\leq 3) that is still painted white (it can be shown that such a cell always exists at the time of the operation). The player performing the operation scores A_{i,j} points. Then, if the player is Takahashi, he paints the cell (i, j) red; if the player is Aoki, he paints it blue.\n\nAfter each operation, the following checks are made:\n\n- Check if there are three consecutive cells painted the same color (red or blue) in any row, column, or diagonal. If such a sequence exists, the game ends immediately, and the player whose color forms the sequence wins.\n- Check if there are white cells left. If no white cells remain, the game ends, and the player with the higher total score wins.\n\nIt can be shown that the game will always end after a finite number of moves, and either Takahashi or Aoki will win. Determine which player wins if both play optimally for victory.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA_{1,1} A_{1,2} A_{1,3}\r\nA_{2,1} A_{2,2} A_{2,3}\r\nA_{3,1} A_{3,2} A_{3,3}\n\nOutput\n\nIf Takahashi wins, print Takahashi; if Aoki wins, print Aoki.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- |A_{i,j}| \\leq 10^9\n- \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 A_{i,j} is odd.\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n0 0 0\r\n0 1 0\r\n0 0 0\n\nSample Output 1\n\nTakahashi\r\n\nIf Takahashi chooses cell (2,2) in his first move, no matter how Aoki plays afterward, Takahashi can always act to prevent three consecutive blue cells. If three consecutive red cells are formed, Takahashi wins. If the game ends without three consecutive red cells, at that point, Takahashi has scored 1 point and Aoki 0 points, so Takahashi wins either way.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n-1 1 0\r\n-4 -2 -5\r\n-4 -1 -5\n\nSample Output 2\n\nAoki",

Then, the number of empty seats becomes K again.\n- Otherwise, guide the entire group at the front of the queue to the attraction. The front group is removed from the queue, and the number of empty seats decreases by the number of people in the group.\n\n\n- Go back to step 1.\n\nHere, no additional groups will line up after the guidance has started.

Takahashi wants to minimize the score, while Aoki wants to maximize it.\r\nFind the score when both players play optimally.\n\n\nDefinition of a walk\r\n    A walk on an undirected graph (possibly a tree) is a sequence of k vertices and k-1 edges v_1,e_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_{k-1},e_{k-1},v_k (where k is a positive integer)\r\n    such that edge e_i connects vertices v_i and v_{i+1}. The same vertex or edge can appear multiple times in the sequence.  \r\n    A walk is said to pass through vertex x if there exists at least one i (1\\leq i\\leq k) such that v_i=x. (There can be multiple such i.)  \r\n    The walk is said to start and end at v_1 and v_k, respectively, and the length of the walk is the sum of the lengths of e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_{k-1}.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nU_1 V_1 L_1\r\nU_2 V_2 L_2\r\n\\vdots\r\nU_{N-1} V_{N-1} L_{N-1}\n\nOutput\n\nPrint N lines.\r\nThe i-th line (1\\leq i\\leq N) should contain the answer to the problem for K=i.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 2\\leq N\\leq 2\\times 10^5\n- 1\\leq U_i<V_i\\leq N\n- 1\\leq L_i\\leq 10^9\n- All input values are integers.\n- The given graph is a tree.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\r\n1 2 3\r\n2 3 5\r\n2 4 2\r\n1 5 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n16\r\n22\r\n26\r\n26\r\n26\r\n\nFor K=1, Aoki's optimal move is to specify vertex 3, and Takahashi's optimal move is to construct a path vertex 1 \\to vertex 2 \\to vertex 3 \\to vertex 2 \\to vertex 1, resulting in a score of 16.\nFor K=2, Aoki's optimal move is to specify vertices 3 and 5, and Takahashi's optimal move is to construct a path such as vertex 1 \\to vertex 5 \\to vertex 1 \\to vertex 2 \\to vertex 3 \\to vertex 2 \\to vertex 1, resulting in a score of 22.\nFor K\\geq 3, the score when both players play optimally is 26.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\r\n1 2 1000000000\r\n2 3 1000000000\n\nSample Output 2\n\n4000000000\r\n4000000000\r\n4000000000\r\n\nBeware that the answer may not fit in a 32-bit integer.",

However, you can do this only if the other hand is not on the destination part.\n\nThe following figure shows the initial state and examples of operations that can and cannot be made from there. The number written on each part of the ring represents the part number, and the circles labeled L and R represent your left and right hands, respectively.\n\nYou need to follow Q instructions given to you in order.\nThe i-th (1 \\leq i \\leq Q) instruction is represented by a character H_i and an integer T_i, meaning the following:\n\n- Perform some number of operations (possibly zero) so that your left hand (if H_i is L) or your right hand (if H_i is R) is holding part T_i.\n  Here, you must not move the other hand not specified by H_i.\n\nIt is guaranteed that only achievable instructions are given.\n\nDetails\nUnder the settings of this problem, it can be proved that the positions of both hands are uniquely determined just before following the i-th instruction for each i.\nAt that time, if we denote the positions of the left and right hands as parts l_i and r_i, respectively, it is guaranteed that T_i \\neq r_i when H_i is L, and T_i \\neq l_i when H_i is R.\n\n\nFind the minimum total number of operations required to follow all the instructions.\n\nInput\n\nThe Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN Q\nH_1 T_1\nH_2 T_2\n\\vdots\nH_Q T_Q\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the minimum total number of operations required to follow all the instructions.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 3 \\leq N \\leq 100\n- 1 \\leq Q \\leq 100\n- H_i is L or R.\n- 1 \\leq T_i \\leq N\n- N, Q, and T_i are integers.\n- Only achievable instructions are given (see the problem statement for details).\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6 3\nR 4\nL 5\nR 6\n\nSample Output 1\n\n8\n\n\nBy performing the following operations, you can follow all Q instructions in order.\n\n- Move your right hand as part 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 to follow the first instruction.\n- Move your left hand as part 1 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 5 to follow the second instruction.\n- Move your right hand as part 4 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 6 to follow the third instruction.\n\nIn this case, the total number of operations is 2+2+4=8, which is the minimum.\n(Note that when following the third instruction, you cannot move your right hand as part 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6.)\n\nSample Input 2\n\n100 2\nL 1\nR 2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0\n\nThere are cases where you can follow the instructions without performing any operations.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n30 8\nR 23\nR 26\nR 29\nL 20\nR 29\nR 19\nL 7\nL 16\n\nSample Output 3\n\n92",

Among these, (2,2) is occupied by bar 3 and (2,4) is occupied by bar 4, so nothing happens.\n- i = 2: The cells directly below bar 2 are (4,2),(4,3), which are not occupied by any other bar, so bar 2 moves down by one cell.\n- i = 3: The cells directly below bar 3 are (3,1),(3,2), which are not occupied by any other bar, so bar 3 moves down by one cell.\n- i = 4: The cell directly below bar 4 is (3,4), which is not occupied by any other bar, so bar 4 moves down by one cell.\n\n\n- At t = 1.5:\n- i = 1: The cells directly below bar 1 are (2,2),(2,3),(2,4), which are not occupied by any other bar, so bar 1 moves down by one cell.\n- i = 2: Bar 2 is on the bottom row, so nothing happens.\n- i = 3: The cells directly below bar 3 are (4,1),(4,2). Among these, (4,2) is occupied by bar 2, so nothing happens.\n- i = 4: The cell directly below bar 4 is (4,4), which is not occupied by any other bar, so bar 4 moves down by one cell.\n\n\n\nAt times t = 2.5, 3.5, \\dots, there is no bar such that the cells directly below it are all unoccupied, so nothing happens. Thus, the grid at time t = 10^{100} is the same as at t = 2 (the rightmost diagram above).\nTherefore, R'_1 = 2, R'_2 = 4, R'_3 = 3, R'_4 = 4.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n382 382 3\r\n3 3 3\r\n8 8 8\r\n2 2 2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n382\r\n382\r\n381\n\nSample Input 3\n\n5 10 8\r\n2 2 1\r\n4 3 1\r\n4 8 2\r\n1 2 2\r\n2 5 3\r\n5 4 3\r\n4 5 2\r\n1 5 2\n\nSample Output 3\n\n5\r\n5\r\n5\r\n4\r\n3\r\n5\r\n4\r\n2",

There is no path with a maximum edge weight less than or equal to 4, so 5 is the minimum possible.\n- f(1,4) = 2: The path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 passing through vertex 3 contains edge 1 with a maximum edge weight of 2. There is no path with a maximum edge weight less than or equal to 1, so 2 is the minimum possible.\n- f(3,4) = 1: The path from vertex 3 to vertex 4 passing through the direct edge contains an edge with a maximum edge weight of 1.

Here, 0 = A_1 < A_2 < \\dots < A_N \\leq 10^{18}.\nFor each integer i from 1 through 2^{100} - A_N - 1, define f(i) as follows:\n\n- The number of k = 1, 2, \\dots, N such that the (i + A_k)-th crease from the left is a mountain fold.\n\nFind the maximum value among f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(2^{100} - A_N - 1).\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 \\cdots A_N\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer in one line.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^3\n- 0 = A_1 < A_2 < \\dots < A_N \\leq 10^{18}\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\n0 1 2 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nIf mountain and valley folds are represented by M and V, respectively, there is a contiguous subsequence of creases like MMVM. There is no contiguous subsequence like MMMM, so the answer is 3.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n6\n0 2 3 5 7 8\n\nSample Output 2\n\n4",

When all of these are sorted in lexicographical order, s_i comes a_i-th, and t_i comes b_i-th.\n- Here, if there are identical sequences among the 2N sequences, a and b are not defined.\n\nTherefore, if a and b are defined, each integer from 1 through 2N appears exactly once in the concatenation of a and b.\nYou are given sequences A and B of length N, where each element of A is an integer between 1 and 2N, and each element of B is either an integer between 1 and 2N or -1.\nAlso, in the concatenation of A and B, each integer other than -1 appears at most once.\nHow many pairs of sequences a,b are there such that a and b are defined and the following holds for each integer i from 1 through N?\n\n- a_i = A_i.\n- b_i = B_i if B_i \\neq -1.\n\nFind the count modulo 998244353.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 \\ldots A_N\nB_1 B_2 \\ldots B_N\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the count modulo 998244353.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 2 \\leq N \\leq 3000\n- 1 \\leq A_i \\leq 2N\n- 1 \\leq B_i \\leq 2N or B_i = -1.\n- In the concatenation of A and B, each integer other than -1 appears at most once. That is,\n- A_i \\neq A_j if i \\neq j.\n- B_i \\neq B_j if i \\neq j and B_i,B_j \\neq -1.\n- A_i \\neq B_j.\n\n\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n2 3 6\n-1 1 -1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n\nFor example, consider creating the following three sequences:\n\n- (1,2,3)\n- (2,1,1)\n- (3,3,2)\n\nIn this case, when sorting s_i and t_i lexicographically, we have:\n\nt_2 = (1,1,2) < s_1 = (1,2,3) < s_2 = (2,1,1) < t_3 = (2,3,3) < t_1 = (3,2,1) < s_3 = (3,3,2)\n\nThus, (a_1,a_2,a_3,b_1,b_2,b_3) = (2,3,6,5,1,4). Here, a matches the given A, and the second element of b also matches that of B, so this is one pair of sequences a,b satisfying the conditions.\nOn the other hand, if we create the following three sequences, s_1 and t_1 become identical, so a and b are not defined.\n\n- (1,2,1)\n- (2,1,3)\n- (3,3,2)\n\nIn fact, a=(2,3,6), b=(5,1,4) is the only pair of sequences satisfying the conditions.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n15\n5 16 1 12 30 20 4 13 9 8 24 21 26 28 17\n-1 -1 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 29 -1 -1 -1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n758094847\n\nPrint the count modulo 998244353.",
